  A collection of functions that calculate the log likelihood for a range of
  statistical tests.  The evidential approach used is based on books
  "Likelihood" by A.W.F. Edwards (1992), "Statistical Evidence" by R. Royall
  (1997). This module/package accompanies "Evidence-Based Statistics" by P.
  Cahusac (2020). The purpose of analyses is to compare hypotheses or models.
  Nulls, hypotheses and models can be specified in the analyses, and the
  relative evidence obtained. The log likelihood or support, is denoted by S in
  all the analyses. Values can range from -ve infintity to +ve infinity. A +ve
  value of S indicates greater support for one hypothesis over another.  A -ve
  value of S indicates greater support for the second hypothesis. Zero indicates
  no evidence either way.  A value of S exceeding the range -2 < 0 < 2 indicates
  moderate evidence. Stronger evidence is indicated by S values  exceeding the
  range -3 < 0 < 3, and so on. Likelihood intervals are represented by Support
  intervals, where an S-2  interval indicates hypothesis estimates that are
  consistent within the range -2 < 0 < 2 for S, and S-3 within a range  -3 < 0 <
  3. Some S values are corrected to Sc for the number of parameters in the
  models being compared.

    description: |
      The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable, and one or more categorical
      explanatory variables. This 'One-Way ANOVA' is a simplified version of
      the 'normal' ANOVA, allowing only a single explanatory factor and.
      dependent variables. Contrasts can be specified whose weights should sum
      to zero, but do not need to be orthogonal to each other. Support values, 
      S, represent log likelihood ratio. They are given for each model 
      comparison. Sc represent Akaike corrected values according to the 
      number of parameters
