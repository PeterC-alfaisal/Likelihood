        The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the relationship
        between a continuous dependent variable, and one or more categorical
        explanatory variables. This 'One-Way ANOVA' is a simplified version of
        the 'normal' ANOVA, allowing only a single explanatory factor and.
        dependent variables. Contrasts can be specified whose weights should sum
        to zero, but do not need to be orthogonal to each other. Support values, 
        S, represent log likelihood ratio. They are given for each model 
        comparison. Sc represent Akaike corrected values according to the 
        number of parameters

            provide Q-Q plots of residuals -- a plot of the actual residuals
            against what would be expected if the data were *perfectly* normally
            distributed. Large deviations from the diagonal line suggest the
            data is not from a normal distribution.

      description:
          ui: >
            provide Levene's tests for the homogeneity of variances. A low
            p-value suggests the groups have unequal variances. A high S value
            suggests that either the group variances are unequal or their 
            variances are closer than you would expect.
          R: >
            `TRUE` or `FALSE` (default), perform Levene's test for homogeneity of
            variances
